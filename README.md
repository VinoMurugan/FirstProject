# Snake Game Project

## About
This repository contains my first project during my software engineering learning journey at Per Scholas. As part of the curriculum, we were tasked with creating our own projects, and I chose to recreate a childhood memory by building a classic Snake Game.

## Project Overview
The Snake Game is a simple yet nostalgic game that many of us played during our childhood. It involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay with intuitive controls.
- Randomly spawning food for the snakes to eat.
- Keep track of scores and high scores.
- Vibrant colors for an engaging experience

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS for the user interface.
- JavaScript for the game logic and functionality.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake(s).
- Eat the food to grow the snake's length and earn points.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own snake's body.
- The game ends when a collision occurs, and you can restart by clicking the "START" button.

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.

Feel free to  provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Enjoy the nostalgia and have fun playing the Snake Game!
